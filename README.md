# Ora_Bolas
## Project FEI Ora Bolas

The Ora Bolas project is an initiative aimed at solving the challenge of robotic soccer, where the robot must track the ball and kick it into the goal. I created a 3D graphic representation of the robot's movement in relation to the ball. Additionally, I produced four more graphs: the position of the ball and the robot over time, the components of the velocity of the ball and the robot, the components of the acceleration of the ball and the robot, and the distance between the ball and the robot.

To install the libraries, use this command in powershell:
```
pip install pywavefront PyGLM numpy pygame moderngl scipy
```
To run the program, use this command:
```
python main.py
```
